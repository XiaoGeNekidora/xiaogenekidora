### Hi there 👋
I am previously known as XiaoGe+ _a certain famous Japanese game/console company that starts with N_ . Now(Dec 2025) I have switched to my new name Nekidora. They both have the abbreviation of XGN so you can call me XGN!

I am majoring _Information and Computational Science (Qiangji Class)_ at Nanjing University, China.

I am interested in game and software development and is currently doing personal projects for fun.

I could write a bit of many programming languages like C++, Java, C#, Python, etc... But my favorite language is Kotlin.

Research Interest: Programming Language and Type System.
